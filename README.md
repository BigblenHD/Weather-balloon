# ADA PCB

ADA standing for Atmospheric Data Acquisition, the goal of this project is self-explanatory. 
The following code is for a PCB that is able to collect information on temperature and air quality. It has self-motion awareness,
can detect gamma rays and can even tell you the time. Isn't that amazing? Ben Lies did a fine programming job. Ben Kasel was a great mentor.

I don't expect many people to read this, so I won't go into too much detail...no detail at all.
There is no person in the world who will try to reproduce this project, so why bother? I am taking a page out of the programmer's book, who never comments his code, expecting the same.



## Reminder for the future self
The real purpose of this readme file is to serve as a memory. 

This project may have officially started 1 year ago (early 2023), but the stepping stone was laid in 2020 (maybe even earlier).
We originally wanted our first project to be a weather balloon, but couldn't as it was too expensive. So, we built a rocket.
It surely had its ups and downs in many ways and who knew: we did it. 
 
  Students learned programming.
  Students learned to solder.
  Students learned frustration.
  Students repeated, until:
  Students built a rocket.

Somehow, quite unexpectedly after that, we were asked to join a project by our professor Ben Kasel. A computer for a weather balloon for the LIST needed to be made and required all the knowledge of the previous project. It is scheduled to be used on Septmeber 14th 2024 in Redange. As this is in the future from the perspective of this article, we will find out if it worked or not. I will add a note beneath this one.

Organising, communication, troubleshooting have been done by Ben Kasel. 
Programming, designing the PCB and "carrying the project" have been done by Ben Lies.
Soldering, supportive commentary and writing (like this article) have been done by Mayers Christophe.
