# ADA PCB

ADA standing for Atmospheric Data Acquisition, the goal of this project is self-explanatory. 
The following code is for a PCB that is able to collect information on temperature and air quality. It has self-motion awareness,
can detect gamma rays and can even tell you the time. Isn't that amazing? Ben Lies did a fine programming job. Ben Kasel was a great mentor.

I don't expect many people to read this, so I won't go into too much detail...no detail at all.
There is no person in the world who will try to reproduce this project, so why bother? I am taking a page out of the programmer's book, who never comments his code, expecting the same.



## Reminder for the future self
The real purpose of this readme file is to serve as a memory. 

This project may have officially started 1 year ago (early 2023), but the stepping stone was laid in 2020 (maybe even earlier).
We originally wanted our first project to be a weather balloon, but couldn't as it was too expensive. So, we built a rocket.
It surely had its ups and downs in many ways and who knew: we did it. 
 
  Students learned programming.
  Students learned to solder.
  Students learned frustration.
  Students repeated, until:
  Students built a rocket.

Somehow, quite unexpectedly after that, we were asked to join a project by our professor Ben Kasel. A computer for a weather balloon for the LIST needed to be made and required all the knowledge of the previous project. It is scheduled to be used on Septmeber 14th 2024 in Redange. As this is in the future from the perspective of this article, we will find out if it worked or not. I will add a note beneath this one.

*15.09.2024
We are one day after launch and it couldn't have worked better. We had clear, warm and not too windy weather. The balllon started at around 14:06 and landed around 2 h afterwards in Verdune (France). Professional opinions claimed it should have landed around Metz. I didn't bother to confirm how far that is from Verdune, but far enough for me to think that Metz wasn't close to it. Verdun is famous for its gardens, and apparently big forests. Our search was luckily facilitated by a precise GPS signal. The box was completely intact because of trees which damped the fall by holding on to the parachute. Everything was able to be recovered without issue: the GoPro, the micro sd card with all our data on and even the little "Bompel" figurine on the outside of the box. What a champ. All acquired information will be available on github. I should perhaps work on this readme file a little better. MAybe some students in the future might try to upgrade our project. Dear future students, please hit us up if you plan on doing so.


Organising, communication, troubleshooting have been done by Ben Kasel. 
Programming, designing the PCB and "carrying the project" have been done by Ben Lies.
Soldering, supportive commentary and writing (like this article) have been done by Mayers Christophe.
The project included more people...I should show them the same courtesy I did to myself: add their name to this file. I guess I will do that in the future. 

Stuff for me to do:
* Upgrade & digitalise documents on PCB preparations
* Update Bene's code and make it userfriendly + explain what dependencies ought to be used.  
* Ask Bene for his PCB design sheet, put it on there as well

* organise this mess of a project: pre-launch, launch, post launch
* add zipp folder with all the stizzel, one seperate file with the actual data of the flight
